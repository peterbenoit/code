<p>I don't really care if you get this wrong, though I do notice it when it happens! ðŸ¤«</p>
<p>English is a fun and often confusing language that even the experts disagree about. If you are not sure which version of "you are" to use, here are some options.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You're</li>
  <li>Your</li>
  <li>Yer</li>
  <li>Ur</li>
  <li>Yous</li>
</ul>

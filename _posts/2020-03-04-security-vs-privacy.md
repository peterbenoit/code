Security and Privacy are very different. Think "Google is very secure but not private".

For example, for privacy we often want deniability—you can’t prove a statement came from me. For security we might want authenticity (you know the statement is from me and not an impostor) or even non-repudiation (I can’t sign a contract then later claim I never signed it).

One reliable absolute in security and privacy is there are no absolutes.

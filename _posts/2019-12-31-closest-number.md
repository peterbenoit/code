<p>Today I needed to find a way to match a number in an array to a specific number. For my case, it was matching the window width with each of the Bootstrap 4 breakpoints.</p>
<p>I found a version of this snippet <i>somewhere</i> (I am assuming Stack Overflow, but I cannot find it!), and thought it was a gem worth holding onto because of its simplicity and elegance.</p>

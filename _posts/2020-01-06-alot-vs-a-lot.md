<p>Here I go again, trying to fix everyone on the Internets!</p>
<p>When I see folks using "alot" instead of "a lot" I want to scream at them and yell "WHY WEREN'T YOU PAYING ATTENTION IN HIGH SCHOOL‚Åâ"</p>
<p>But then again, whatevers.</p>
<p>An easy way to remember that you shouldn't use "alot" a lot, is to wonder "would I use alittle?".</p>
<p>If the answer is a resounding "yes!", then carry on with your nonsense.</p>
